NOTES:
- [x]  https://scotch.io/courses/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-algorithms/array-chunking 
            - [ ] Accept, Store, Process, Output data
            - [ ] Abstract data types (ADT): array, list map, queue, set, stack, table, tree, and vectors
            - [ ] Priori analysis - theoretical evaluation in which factors such as processor speed are assumed to be constant and are not considered as having any effect on the algorithmic implementation
            - [ ] Posteriori Analysis: practical evaluation carried out by implementing the algorithm using a selected programming language.  Algorithm is then tested on a computer while observing the time taken and memory consumed.
            - [ ] Big O Notation - worst case scenario, upper bound
